# CampaNeo after consent vizualisation
A user interface to visualize data sharing activities of users in the CamapNeo project. Data is given to specific campaigns who ask for consent from the user. Then the user gets a transparent view of his data sharing activities. Who uses the data? What data is used? When was it retrieved?
